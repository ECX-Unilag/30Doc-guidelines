## General Submission Guidelines
- 0 means unmarked
- 1 means you didn't follow the submission instructions and score won't be changed

## 3D Modeling & Animation
An acceptable submission is a Google Drive link to a .blend file that contains the required design. 

### How to submit:
- Export your project as a .blend file. 
- Open a Google Drive Folder with your name. This is where you'll upload each day's task. 
- Upload your .blend file to your Google Drive with a descriptive name (eg, Day 01 #30DaysOfBlender). 
- Set your Google Drive link to “Anyone on the internet can view.”
- Submit the link at https://ecx.org.ng/30doc/

## Back-End Web Development
### Accepted Languages
- Python (Flask)
- PHP/Laravel

### How to Submit (Flask submissions only):
- Asides from the last task on day 30, participants are expected to create a new repository and push the code for each day to the repo and share a link to the repository on the 30DOC dashboard (https://ecx.org.ng/30doc/).
- For the 30th day of the program, share the link to the Heroku deployment instead
- **Note**: You are to create one repo for all your tasks.

### How to Submit (Laravel submissions only):
- Unless stated otherwise, all submissions should be the GitHub link to the README.md file of the repository containing your server-side code. 
- The README should contain the link to the endpoint of where your server-side script is running, and any other information specifically asked for.




## Data Analysis
The project is split into three categories: Tableau, SQL & Python (for data). 
- Day 1-10: Tableau
- Day 11-20: SQL
- Day 21-30: Python

### For Tableau (Day 1-10):
Upload your visualization to Tableau Public and send the link to the dashboard. Learn how to upload your dashboard to Tableau Public here: https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/publish_workbooks_tableaupublic.htm

## Front-End Web Development
For tasks involving functions: Repl.it links to the code will suffice.

For tasks involving building of components/apps: An acceptable submission is a GitHub link containing the code with a link to the hosted project in the README.md or a link to [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)/[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/)

#### **The following only applies to the tasks involving components/apps:**

### How to submit:
- Create an account on GitHub and open a new repo with the name 30DaysOfCode
- Create a repo per task or a repo for all the tasks with different folders named after the day. Example: “Day 1” “Day One” etc. with the link for each day posted in the README.
- Copy the link to that repo from your browser and submit at https://ecx.org.ng/30doc/


### Marking Guide
- 1 - Checking Input Type
- 1 - Participation
- 1 - Concise & Clean Code
- 1 - Proper variable naming
- 3 - Function body works properly
- 3 - Function follows exact question specs


#### ***Tips:***
- Follow instructions.
- A submission that is not hosted is considered null and would not be marked.
- Submission without the hosted link provided in the README is considered null.
- Multiple submissions are considered void.
- Use external styling and ensure your site is responsive.

#### ***Extra tip for Front-End Beginners***
- You shouldn’t always try to implement exactly what is in a given example. The example is just a guideline for what your work should look like.

## Game Development 
An acceptable submission is a GitHub link. 

### How to Submit:
- Upload a link to your GitHub page 
- You can update an existing project and resend the link, we would track the commit history

## Python
An acceptable submission is a repl.it link containing the program, preferably in the main.py file on the site.

### How to submit:
- Create an account on repl.it and open a new repl.
- Write your code in the main.py file already opened and test that it works.
- Copy the link to that repl from your browser and submit at https://ecx.org.ng/30doc/

### Grading Criteria (Total: 10 points):
- 3 points: The code works
- 3 points: It follows exactly the specifications of the task
- 2 points: Well structured, simple, and efficient code
- 2 points: Bug-free code (after testing for special cases such as Type checking, and Exception Handling.) 

### Tips to get high grades:
- Follow instructions.
- Ensure that your functions only take in the right input types.
- Include documentation strings.

## UI
Accepted submissions should be in jpeg or png formats.

### How to Submit:

- Export your designs in either jpeg or png formats.
- Share your designs on Twitter with #ECX30daysofdesign and the prompt (day) number (ex. "Just finished my design for #ECX30daysofdesign #01"), and include the link to your figma design as well 
- Submit the link to your Twitter post on the 30 Days of Code and Design website at https://ecx.org.ng/30doc/
