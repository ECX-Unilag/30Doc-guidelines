## Front-End Web Development
An acceptable submission is a GitHub link containing the code with a link to the hosted project in the README.md or a link to CodePen/CodeSandbox

### How to submit:
- Create an account on GitHub and open a new repo with the name 30DaysOfCode
- Create a repo per task or a repo for all the tasks with different folders named after the day. Example: “Day 1” “Day One” etc. with the link for each day posted in the README.
- Copy the link to that repo from your browser and submit at https://ecx.org.ng/30doc/

### Tips :
- Follow instructions.
- A submission that is not hosted is considered null and would not be marked.
- Submission without the hosted link provided in the README is considered null.
- A bootstrap submission is considered null unless stated in the instructions that you can use it.
- Multiple submissions are considered void.
- Be creative with the use of colors. Use external styling and ensure your site is responsive.

### Extra tip for Front-End Beginners.
- You shouldn’t always try to implement exactly what is in a given example. The example is just a guideline for what your work should look like.
- Don't try to implement examples and mess up your job.
- If you are to implement the design, it will be added to the task description.
